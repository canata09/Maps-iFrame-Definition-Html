## What is the Perfect Maps iFrame Definition Html?

You can use an iframe to insert Maps into your HTML document. Below you can find an example of an iframe for Google Maps.

In this sample document, the map is embedded within the <iframe> tag. The src attribute specifies the URL of the embedded map. Usually the location specified by the q parameter is shown.

The 'width' and 'height' properties are specified as the width and height of the iframe. We remove the border around the frame using the 'frameborder'="0" style.

The 'allowfullscreen' property allows the iframe to switch to fullscreen mode.
